## Background of Ezra

> *Ezra apparently had official status as a commissioner of the Persian government, and his title, “scribe of the law of the God of heaven,” is best understood as “royal secretary for Jewish religious affairs,” or the like. The Persians were tolerant of native [cults](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/cults) but, in order to avert internal strife and to prevent religion from becoming a mask for rebellion, insisted that these be regulated under responsible authority. The delegated authority over the Jews of the satrapy (administrative area) “beyond the river” (Avar-nahara), or west of the Euphrates River, was entrusted to Ezra; for a Jew to disobey the Law he brought was to disobey “the law of the king.”* - [**Ezra** | Encyclopædia Britannica](ahttps://www.britannica.com/biography/Ezra-Hebrew-religious-leader)

## 1. Preparation Paves the Way for Prosperity

### **Highlight**

> “For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the LORD, and to do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments.” - Ezra 7:10 

### **Explanation**

Ezra the scribe made himself ready to *consult* the Law of God and to *obey* it’s commands. 

### **Application**

In order to receive divine - and earthly - favor, I must also make internal preparations to study God’s Word and commit in advance to obey the precepts and principals found therein.
